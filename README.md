## Description
This deep learning project leverages the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset for brain tumor detection, classification, and segmentation. In addition, it incorporates eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to generate preventive measures and track patient progress.

The primary objectives of this project include:

Detecting the presence of brain tumors within medical imaging data.
Classifying the detected tumors into different categories (e.g., glioblastoma, meningioma).
Segmenting the tumor regions within brain scans.
Utilizing eXplainable AI to generate insights into preventive measures and monitor patient progress.
The project combines state-of-the-art deep learning models with advanced XAI techniques to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, ultimately improving patient care.

This Flask web application provides a user interface for brain tumor prediction. Users can upload brain scan images to get predictions and view explanations of the predictions.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the BraTS dataset, a benchmark in the field of brain tumor research. The dataset includes multi-modal brain scans, allowing for comprehensive analysis and diagnosis. Researchers and contributors can access and download the dataset through the provided link.
